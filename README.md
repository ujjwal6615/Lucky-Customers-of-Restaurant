# Lucky-Customers-of-Restaurant
• A C++ program in which customers have to order their food a/c to their choices from the menu. • At last, at the time of bill payment, they will have to play a game of lucky draw. • They have to pick a number from 1 to 5, and if they picked the right no., they will get flat 15% discount on the Bill.
